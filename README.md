# End_to_end-SQL-and-PowerBI-project
In this project, I took the role of a data analyst and worked through the complete process of turning raw data into actionable insights. Using the provided dataset(excel files), I used SQL server 2022 to manipulate data,create queries , linked my SQL file to PowerBi and designed and built an interactive dashboard that highlights key project details and performance metrics.

Throughout the project, I learned how to:

-Build a Database – set up and organize my data using SQL.

-Connect to Power BI – integrate my database with Power BI for analysis.

-Build a Dashboard – create a clear, engaging dashboard that summarizes the key details of my project
